<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! My name is Bahram Johari, and I’m a passionate web developer who loves turning ideas into clean, functional, and visually appealing digital experiences. I enjoy working with modern web technologies and bringing concepts to life through thoughtful design, efficient code, and user-focused solutions.

  I’m constantly learning, improving, and exploring new tools that help me build better websites and applications. Whether it’s front-end development, responsive UI design, or creating smooth user interactions, I’m always excited to take on new challenges.
  
  When I’m not coding, I enjoy working on personal projects, expanding my skills, and staying up to date with trends in web development. My goal is to create meaningful digital products and continue growing as a developer—one project at a time.</p>
